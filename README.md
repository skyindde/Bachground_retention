# Bachground_retention
retaining the background from a times lapse video using mode and custom build function

the idea of ustom filter is to reatin the pixel, which has showed up most number of times in the time lapse video.
there might be people/objects coming and going which will give a series of pixel values over time.
the pixel value of background is most likely to stay constant for a brief period of time when there is no obstacle in front.
Also, this occurance of stable pixel value will repeat multiple number of time when there will be no object in front of it
fro the people/obstacles, the pixel value is less likely ti stay constant as the move. also, they are less likely to be dead still.
also, different people will be wearing diffrent color of clothes so repetation is highly unlikely.

from experiments, it was observed that for better results, long duration videos are preferred.
